### About Me
Hello, and welcome to my GitHub profile! ðŸ‘‹  
I specialize in developing robust solutions for **date and time manipulation** and have a strong passion for clean, modular, and efficient coding practices. My work focuses on simplifying complex temporal data tasks, ensuring precision and scalability for various applications.

### Project Highlight: **Handling Date & Time**
This project explores essential techniques for extracting and processing temporal information. Below, I detail key functionalities covered in the project, along with sample implementations:

#### 1. **Extracting the Year**  
Extracting the year is a fundamental operation when working with date-time objects. It is particularly useful for time-series analysis and trend observations.

**Definition**:  
The process of isolating the year component from a date object.  

**Code Example**:  
```python
from datetime import datetime

# Current date and time
current_date = datetime.now()

# Extract the year
year = current_date.year
print(f"Year: {year}")
```

**Output**:  
If today's date is `2025-01-27`, the output will be:
```
Year: 2025
```

---

#### 2. **Extracting the Month**  
Months are often required for seasonal analysis, monthly reporting, and more.

**Definition**:  
The method of obtaining the month value (1-12) from a date-time object.

**Code Example**:  
```python
# Extract the month
month = current_date.month
print(f"Month: {month}")
```

**Output**:  
For the same date, the output will be:
```
Month: 1
```

---

#### 3. **Extracting the Day**  
Days of the month play a crucial role in daily operations and calendar-based applications.

**Definition**:  
Isolating the day component (1-31) from a given date.

**Code Example**:  
```python
# Extract the day
day = current_date.day
print(f"Day: {day}")
```

**Output**:  
For the same date:
```
Day: 27
```

---

#### 4. **Formatting Dates**  
Often, dates need to be formatted into human-readable or specific patterns for display or storage.

**Definition**:  
Converting a date-time object into a string using predefined or custom formats.

**Code Example**:  
```python
# Format the date as 'YYYY-MM-DD'
formatted_date = current_date.strftime('%Y-%m-%d')
print(f"Formatted Date: {formatted_date}")
```

**Output**:  
```
Formatted Date: 2025-01-27
```
